# Signal Desktop for LPC [signal-server](https://github.com/LPC-language/signal-server)

This is a fork of Signal Desktop v6.18.1.  The following relevant modifications
have been made:

-   `config/default.json`, `config/production.json`  

    The server URLs have been set to `dworkin.nl` internal domains, a
    `dworkin.nl` root certificate was added to `certificateAuthority`, and
    `serverPublicParams` was changed to a new value, generated by
    `signal-server`.
